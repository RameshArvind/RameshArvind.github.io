      <description>Well here we are. Its 2020, another year/decade. I didn&amp;rsquo;t do a review last year but hopefully starting this year I&amp;rsquo;ll try to be more conscious about it.
Things that happened  January  ML fellowship at fellowship.ai 2nd semester in OMSCS - Reinforcement Learning and Machine Learning for Trading   February / March  Externship at fellowship.ai Opportunity to shift to MSCS on campus   April / May / June / July  Taking time off from studying   August  Moved to Atlanta 3rd semester at Georgia Tech - Machine Learning / Deep Learning for Videos / Computer Vision   September / October  Summer Internship Hunt Interviewed at Amazon Robotics / Neosis / Worthix / Credit Karma   November  Internship offer from Worthix   December  Wrapping up semester Studying up on AlphaGO - MCTS / UCT    Reflections for 2019 I started a master&amp;rsquo;s program to just get my foot into machine learning jobs, but honestly those 60 odd questions I solved on leetcode gave me the confidence I was lacking in my earlier job hunt than the masters program itself.</description>

      <description>This dates back to when I was in high school around start of my 10th grade. I got access to internet for the first time in my life 1.
Up until this point, my only interactions with a computer was purely as a device for gaming. I used to spend a disproportionate of time playing games 2.
I made an account on facebook and played the games on it cause it was all the rage at the time.</description>

      <description>OMSCS is Georgia Tech&amp;rsquo;s Online Master&amp;rsquo;s Program in Computer Science. It is run fully online, generally taken up by working professionals.
I enrolled into the program in Fall Semester (September - December) of 2018 thus completing one semester at the time of writing.
Before I considered OMSCS I originally intended to apply to on-campus programs in the US, but I ended up skipping out multiple times
 First when my peers applied right out of their undergraduate program When my co-workers applied first year into their career and when they applied second year into their career  Each time I kept thinking &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not going to procrastinate this year and apply&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Why even blog? So then, this is probably going to be a pretty boring intro to what I&amp;rsquo;m trying to get at by blogging.
I spend a lot time on the internet, it&amp;rsquo;s actually more surprising when I don&amp;rsquo;t find myself on it. I&amp;rsquo;m easily distracted when I&amp;rsquo;m trying to be productive and have a hard time trying to focus. There are specific things I&amp;rsquo;d like to achieve by blogging</description>
