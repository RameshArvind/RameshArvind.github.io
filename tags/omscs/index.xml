      <description>OMSCS is Georgia Tech&amp;rsquo;s Online Master&amp;rsquo;s Program in Computer Science. It is run fully online, generally taken up by working professionals.
I enrolled into the program in Fall Semester (September - December) of 2018 thus completing one semester at the time of writing.
Before I considered OMSCS I originally intended to apply to on-campus programs in the US, but I ended up skipping out multiple times
 First when my peers applied right out of their undergraduate program When my co-workers applied first year into their career and when they applied second year into their career  Each time I kept thinking &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not going to procrastinate this year and apply&amp;rdquo;.</description>
